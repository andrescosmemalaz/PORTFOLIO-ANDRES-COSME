    image: portfolio10,
    description:"The project to improve processes in the mining industry through automation technologies aims to optimize and streamline the processes of payroll, auditing, financial control and accounting in the mining industry. The use of advanced automation technologies reduces costs and increases efficiency. To achieve this, previously analyzed process automation systems are used, using technologies such as VBA, Python or RPA tools (UiPath, Power Automate Desktop). In addition, the benefits of artificial intelligence and data analysis tools are used to automate repetitive tasks.",

    description:"Machine Learning projects range from basic to advanced cases, where techniques such as linear regression, clustering or classification are used to solve prediction or data segmentation problems. In intermediate projects, more sophisticated algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, SVM, among others, can be used. In addition, they can be applied in different areas such as trading, rock analysis in mining and supply chain optimization, where predictive models can be created to make informed decisions and improve process efficiency.",
